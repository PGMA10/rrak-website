Both forms should submit to the appropriate API endpoints (/api/email-marketing-waitlist and /api/print-materials-waitlist) that were set up with the CRM backend earlier.
Style the cards with the brand navy and orange colors. Make them visually distinct as "coming soon" but still professional and exciting.
