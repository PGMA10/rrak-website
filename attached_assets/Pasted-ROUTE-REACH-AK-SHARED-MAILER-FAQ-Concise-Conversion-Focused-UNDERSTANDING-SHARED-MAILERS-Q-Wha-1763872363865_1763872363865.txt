ROUTE REACH AK - SHARED MAILER FAQ
Concise & Conversion-Focused

UNDERSTANDING SHARED MAILERS
Q: What is a shared mailer campaign?
A: 16 businesses share one premium 9×12" postcard mailed to 5,000 Anchorage households. Each business gets a 2.8" × 3.8" ad slot with industry exclusivity - only ONE business per category per card.
You reach 5,000 potential customers for $600 instead of $4,000+ for a solo campaign.

Q: What makes Route Reach AK different?
A: I handle everything. You provide your goal, logo, and photos (if you have them). I handle:
Strategy & copywriting
Professional design
Print coordination
USPS mailing execution
QR code tracking
You spend ~30 minutes total. I do the rest. You focus on running your business.

Q: Who is this for?
A: Business owners who are great at their craft but don't want to become marketing experts.
If marketing feels overwhelming or draining, this is for you. I take the entire process off your plate and deliver professional results.

HOW IT WORKS
Q: How does the shared mailer process work?
A: Four steps:
Book Your Slot - Choose your industry category (first-come, first-served)
Fill Out Design Brief - Submit brand material(logo, colors and fonts), image(if you have one), Tagline(if you have one) and a brief message.
Design & Approval - I create your ad. You approve it (2 revisions included)
Print & Mail - I coordinate printing and USPS EDDM delivery to 5,000 households
Track Results - Your unique QR code shows how many people engaged
Timeline: 3-4 weeks from booking to mailboxes.

Q: What do I need to provide?
Required:
Business logo (any format)
What you want to promote (your offer/goal)
Contact info (phone OR website)
Optional:
Photos of your work/products/team
Brand colors
Existing marketing materials
Your time: ~30 minutes total.

Q: Is my ad slot big enough?
A: Yes. Each slot is 2.8" × 3.8" - designed to include:
Logo
Headline (6-10 words)
Core offer (1-2 lines)
QR code (your conversion tool)
Phone OR website
The QR code links to your website, contact page, booking page, or landing page with full details. Your ad creates awareness and drives action. Clarity beats clutter.

Q: What if I don't like my design?
A: You approve everything before it prints. I send you a proof, you request changes (included), we iterate until you're satisfied. Your ad doesn't mail unless you're happy with it.

Competitors who try to book after you see your category is unavailable.

RESULTS & ROI
Q: What kind of results should I expect?
Direct mail averages 1-3% response rate. Here's what that means:
5,000 households see your ad
50-150 people take action (QR scan, call, visit)
10-30% convert to customers
Result: 5-45 new customers from one $600 campaign
ROI Example: If your average customer is worth $200, you need 3 customers to break even. Everything beyond that is profit.
If your average customer is worth $500 (HVAC, dental, legal), 3 customers = $1,500 revenue = 2.5x ROI on $600.
Results vary by industry and offer. First campaigns dial in messaging. Repeat campaigns compound results.

Q: How do I track results?
Three ways:
QR code analytics - See how many people scanned, when, and what device
Phone tracking - Ask callers "How did you hear about us?"
Website traffic spike - If QR links to your site, you'll see the surge
I provide a post-campaign report with your data and optimization recommendations.

Q: How long until I see results?
Days 1-7: Immediate responses (QR scans, calls)
Weeks 2-4: Secondary responses (people who saved the postcard)
Months 2-3: Delayed responses (remembered when they needed you)
Peak response is in the first 2 weeks. Activity continues for months.
This is why 3-month campaigns work - each builds on the last.

TARGETING & LOGISTICS
Q: When is the next campaign?
Campaigns run monthly. Miss this one? Next one mails the first week of February 2026.

Q: What neighborhoods do you target?
Affluent Anchorage areas with $100K-$200K+ household incomes. Homeowners with disposable income - your ideal customers.
Current routes: Abbott Loop, Hillside, Goldenview, Kincaid, Sand Lake, Jewel Lake, and Turnagain.
Q: Do I need professional photos?
No. Many high-performing ads use stock photos (I source them), smartphone photos (with good lighting), or logo-only designs.
Your offer matters more than fancy photography.

TRUST & COMMITMENT
Q: Why should I trust you?
I'm local to Anchorage. You work directly with me - not an account manager.
I handle everything. Strategy, design, copywriting, print, USPS execution, tracking.
Transparent pricing. No hidden fees.
No long-term traps. Month-to-month or 3-month max commitment.
Still unsure? Start with one campaign for $600. See the execution and results. Then decide if you want to continue.

Q: What if I don't get results?
Let's be realistic: No marketing is guaranteed.
What I control: Professional design, compelling copy, flawless execution, performance tracking.
What I don't control: Whether your offer resonates, your follow-through, external factors.
If a campaign underperforms: We review the data, adjust messaging/offer, test until we find what works.
Most businesses need 2-3 campaigns to dial in their message. Consistency compounds results.
